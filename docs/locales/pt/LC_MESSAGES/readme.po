"Valkyrie is a sandbox library for applications that run plugins. It "
"provides a more comprehensive way to setup a set of permissions for each "
"classloader that runs a plugin inside the main application while "
"maintaining full permissions for the application itself."
msgstr ""

#: ../../readme.rst:9
msgid ""
"With Valkyrie is possible to create a *SecurityProfile* that will be used"
" for your application plugins. Each *SecurityProfile* is associated with "
"a *ClassLoader*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../readme.rst:13
msgid ""
"*SecurityProfile* is a interface that must be implemented by the "
"application to set the *PermissionCollection* for the plugins. There are "
"two implementations in Valkyrie, one with no permissions at all and one "
"with all permissions, where the latter is used by default as the "
"application set of permissions."

"Valkyrie acts as a wrapper for the SecurityManager rabbit hole to provide"
" a simpler way to secure your application and the plugins it might run. "
"To do that you are going to define a set o permissions that the plugins "
"have."
msgstr ""

#: ../../readme.rst:82
msgid ""
"The way this works is as a whitelist of permissions, allowing them to do "
"what is explicit described and denying anything else."

msgid ""
"To create a set of permissions create a class that implements the "
"*com.github.marceloaguiarr.valkyrie.profiles.SecurityProfile* interface. "
"This interface has only one method called *getPermissions* that returns a"
" *java.security.PermissionCollection* object. An example is shown below."

"Even though the application has a set of AllPermissions that are still "
"some actions that the SecurityManager will not allow. This might prompt "
"the developer to want to stop Valkyrie to execute their code. This is not"
" advised and Valkyrie does not provide a functionality to stop itself."

"If your business logic requires that the application execute a snippet of"
